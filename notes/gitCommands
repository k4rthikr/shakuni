# List the remotes and the paths
git remote -v

# In our use case, the remote name is "heroku". Usually it is "origin".
# When you pull from heroku, you get the branches copied locally.
# "master" is the default branch. When you push code upstream:

git push heroku karthik
# This pushes it to heroku remote, with branch name karthik

git push heroku karthik:master
# This pushes your local branch karthik to remote branch master.
# Never do that. Its a lame workflow.
